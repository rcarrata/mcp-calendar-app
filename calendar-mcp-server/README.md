# Redwood Digital University Calendar MCP Server

This directory contains a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with the Redwood Digital University academic calendar system, 
providing AI agents with comprehensive access to university scheduling, events, and academic activities.

## Overview

The Calendar MCP server (`server.py`) provides comprehensive academic calendar functionality including:
- **Event Management**: Create, read, update, and delete academic events
- **Schedule Queries**: Search and filter events by various criteria
- **Academic Planning**: View upcoming events and calendar statistics
- **University Integration**: Seamless integration with Redwood Digital University systems

## Key Features

- Integrates with the Calendar API via REST calls
- Supports all major calendar operations through 9 specialized tools
- Handles academic event categories (Lectures, Labs, Assignments, etc.)
- Provides detailed error handling and logging
- Optimized for university academic workflows

## Prerequisites

Before using the Calendar MCP server, make sure you have deployed the Calendar API:

```bash
# Start the Calendar API backend
cd calendar-api/src
uv run uvicorn server:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### Test locally

```bash
# Make the server executable
chmod +x server.py

# Set environment variables for local Calendar API
export CALENDAR_API_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"

# Make sure Calendar API is running first
cd ../calendar-api/src
uv run uvicorn server:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 &
cd ../../calendar-mcp-server

# Run the MCP server directly (it will wait for JSON-RPC input)
python server.py

# Expected output:
# ðŸŽ“ Starting Redwood Digital University Calendar MCP Server
# ðŸ“¡ Calendar API URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000
# âœ… Calendar API connection successful: {'app_name': 'calendar'}
# ðŸ”„ MCP Server ready - waiting for JSON-RPC connections...
```

### Understanding MCP Server Logs

The MCP server now shows helpful logs:
- **ðŸŽ“ Startup message** - Server is starting
- **ðŸ“¡ API URL** - Shows which Calendar API it's connecting to
- **âœ… Connection test** - Confirms API is accessible
- **ðŸ”„ Ready status** - Server is waiting for AI agent connections
- **ðŸ”§ Tool calls** - Shows when AI agents use tools (when connected)

## Testing with AI Agents

Once deployed, you can test the Calendar MCP server with various queries:

### Sample Queries
- "Show me all upcoming lectures this week"
- "Create a new lab session for CS 301 on Friday at 2 PM"
- "What events are scheduled for tomorrow?"
- "Search for all machine learning related events"
- "Update the status of assignment due-001 to completed"
- "Show me calendar statistics for this month"
- "What are the office hours for Dr. Chen?"
- "Delete the canceled workshop event"

### Example API Calls
```bash
# Get all events
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/schedules"

# Get specific event
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/schedules/event-123"

# Create new event
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/schedules" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "sid": "new-event-123",
    "name": "CS 401: Advanced AI",
    "content": "Deep learning applications",
    "category": "Lecture",
    "level": 3,
    "status": 0.0,
    "creation_time": "2025-07-03 12:00:00",
    "start_time": "2025-07-04 10:00:00",
    "end_time": "2025-07-04 11:30:00"
  }'
```

## Configuration

The Calendar MCP server uses the following environment variables:

- `CALENDAR_API_BASE_URL` - Base URL for the Calendar API (default: "http://127.0.0.1:8000")

### Docker/Container Configuration
```bash
# Run with custom API URL
docker run -e CALENDAR_API_BASE_URL="http://calendar-api:8000" calendar-mcp-server:latest
```
